###Age of practice adoption

We derive results when preventative practices are adopted in years 3, 5, or 10 to evaluate conditions when vines are fully trained onto the trellis system and winter pruning begins (3 years old), when vines reach maturity (5 years old), and when trunk disease symptoms typically appear in vineyards (10 years old). These years were selected following grower interviews and discussions with viticulture farm advisors to reflect key stages in a vineyard&#8217;s lifespan.
