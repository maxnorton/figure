<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The grapevine trunk diseases (aka wood-canker diseases) are widespread throughout all of California’s grape-growing regions. This disease complex includes: </p>

<p>Botryosphaeria dieback (aka Bot canker)<br/>
Eutypa dieback<br/>
Phomopsis dieback<br/>
Esca (aka Measles, Young vine decline, Petri disease) </p>

<p>Every California vineyard is eventually infected by one predominant trunk disease or a combination. These diseases significantly reduce yields in mature vineyards by either killing fruiting positions (main impact of the dieback-type diseases) or decreasing vine vigor (main impact of Esca). These impacts accumulate each year, as there are no effective methods to eradicate the wood infections. Diseased vineyards must be replanted prematurely, and the high start-up costs are not repaid.</p>

<p>If adopted in young vineyards, preventative practices can reduce the negative effects of trunk diseases. On this site you will find the results from an economic analysis of early adoption of three field-tested, preventative practices (delayed pruning, double pruning, and application of pruning wound protectant). This research is part of a <a href="http://treeandvinetrunkdiseases.org">trunk disease project</a> funded by a Specialty Crop Research Initiative (SCRI) USDA, National Institute of Food &amp; Agriculture grant. </p>

<p>This site also provides growers an opportunity to enter economic and yield data for their operation to see how trunk diseases and these preventative practices might affect production in their winegrape vineyard.</p>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>

<p>In the following section of this site, you are prompted to select a winegrape growing region, figures of annual yields and cumulative net returns, and tables containing annual and cumulative indicators taken from our economic analysis. You will also be asked to select the preventative practices and vineyard age when a preventative practice is first adopted. The results are determined in part by the disease control efficacy, which are difficult to anticipate. As such, the results are presented across three disease control efficacy rates for these practices based on evidence found in the scientific literature. Links on the page provide descriptions of the preventative practices and disease control efficacy rates as well as definitions of the variables displayed in the figures and tables. All figure and table results list the underlying region-specific parameter values used in the economic analysis.</p>

<p>You will also find <a href="custom-parameters.html">the link to an input form</a> where you will be prompted to enter yield, price, cultural cost, and preventative practice cost information, and then select figures and tables similar to the regional figures and tables generated on this page to display the results.</p>
