##Instructions

The input form below shows the settings for the price per ton for Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, the discount rate, annual additional cost of double pruning per acre, annual cultural cost per acre for selected vineyard ages, and yield per acre for a Northern San Joaquin vineyard, unless another region was selected above. As a reference, the additional cost of delayed pruning is assumed to be zero as it does not cost more to shift when this practice is performed. The additional cost per acre for hand-painting TopsinM and double pruning are shown in the tables below.
