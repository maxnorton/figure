Grapevine trunk diseases (aka wood-canker diseases) are widespread throughout all of California’s grape-growing regions. This disease complex includes: Botryosphaeria dieback (aka Bot canker), Eutypa dieback, Phomopsis dieback, and Esca (aka Measles, Young vine decline, Petri disease).  
 
 Every California vineyard is eventually infected by one predominant trunk disease or a combination. These diseases significantly reduce yields in mature vineyards by either killing fruiting positions (main impact of the dieback-type diseases) or decreasing vine vigor (main impact of Esca). These impacts accumulate each year, as there are no effective methods to eradicate the wood infections. As such, diseased vineyards must be replanted prematurely. If adopted in young vineyards, preventative practices can reduce these negative effects.

<p>On this site you will find useful figures and tables from an economic analysis of early adoption of three field-tested, preventative practices (delayed pruning, double pruning, and application of pruning wound protectant) that will help you understand the potential costs and benefits from adopting trunk disease preventative practices in young winegrape vineyards. You will also be able to enter economic and yield data for your operation to see how trunk diseases and these preventative practices might affect your vineyard.</p>

### How to generate figures and tables
 
 The <a href="#figureparameters" onclick="$('body,html').stop(true,true).animate({scrollTop: $('#figureparameters').offset().top - $('header').height()}, '500', 'swing');">input form</a> below shows the settings for the price per ton for Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, the discount rate, annual additional cost of double pruning per acre, annual cultural cost per acre for selected vineyard ages, and yield per acre for a Northern San Joaquin vineyard. You may use these default values or select another region evaluated in our analysis, and where you vineyard may be is located or is closest in growing conditions to your vineyard. In addition, you can enter your own yield, price, cultural cost, and preventative practice cost information in the <a href="#figureparameters" onclick="$('body,html').stop(true,true).animate({scrollTop: $('#figureparameters').offset().top - $('header').height()}, '500', 'swing');">input form</a> and hit submit to generate figures and tables based on your winegrape vineyards and our economic framework.
 
 Links throughout the site provide additional information about the preventative practices, disease control efficacy rates, and definitions of the variables displayed in the figures and tables.
